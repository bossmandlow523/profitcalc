## NumberInput Purple Outline & Click Issue - Fixed

**Problem:**
1. Purple focus outline appearing around NumberInput fields when clicked
2. All buttons and inputs became unclickable after applying CSS fixes

**Root Cause:**
1. Global `*:focus-visible` CSS rule (index.css:144-146) applied purple outline to ALL elements including inputs
2. `.shimmer-effect::before` pseudo-element (index.css:67-81) created an absolutely positioned overlay covering buttons without `pointer-events: none`, blocking all clicks

**Fix:**
1. Modified `*:focus-visible` selector to exclude inputs: `*:focus-visible:not(input):not([data-slot]):not([role="spinbutton"])`
2. Added comprehensive CSS to remove purple outlines from all NumberInput states (focus, focus-visible, focus-within)
3. Added `pointer-events: none;` to `.shimmer-effect::before` to allow clicks to pass through
4. Made NumberInput slimmer with `min-height: 2.5rem` and `height: auto`
5. Ensured buttons remain clickable with explicit `pointer-events: auto !important` and `z-index: 10`

**Result:**
- No purple outlines on NumberInput fields
- All buttons and inputs fully clickable
- Slimmer, cleaner input appearance
- Shimmer animation still visible but doesn't block interactions

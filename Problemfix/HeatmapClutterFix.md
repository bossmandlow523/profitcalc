## Heatmap Clutter and Density Issue - Fixed

**Problem:** P/L Heatmap was too cluttered with overlapping text values. Too many price rows (33) and too few date columns (9) created a tall, narrow visualization that was difficult to read.

**Root Cause:**
1. Incorrect data point density ratio - vertical price steps far exceeded horizontal date steps
2. Hexagons positioned on rectangular grid instead of proper honeycomb pattern
3. All cell values displayed regardless of hexagon size, causing text overlap

**Fix:**
1. Adjusted default density in PLHeatmap.tsx:39-40 - reduced priceSteps from 33 to 15, increased dateSteps from 9 to 25
2. Implemented proper honeycomb geometry with alternating row offset in CustomHexagonalHeatmap.tsx:210-215
3. Added smart label visibility (only shows when hexRadius ≥ 12px) in CustomHexagonalHeatmap.tsx:221-223
4. Reduced base font size from 0.65em to 0.55em with hover scaling to 0.75em
5. Added interactive tooltip on hover showing full P/L details in CustomHexagonalHeatmap.tsx:254-290

**Result:** Clean, wide heatmap with proper honeycomb pattern. Less clutter, better readability, interactive tooltips for details. 15 rows × 25 columns provides optimal "zoom" level for pattern recognition.

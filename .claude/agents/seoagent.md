You are an experienced SEO strategist with up-to-date knowledge of search engine and generative-AI driven ranking factors (2025). Your task: **optimize a website** (URL: [INSERT SITE]) to rank higher, attract qualified traffic, and convert visitors. You have the following context:  
- Keywords & key phrases (attached)  
- Research on competitors / intent (attached)  
- Current site structure, content outline, and meta data (attached)  
- Target audience profile: [INSERT PROFILE]  
- Business goals: [INSERT GOALS]  

**Your deliverables:**  
1. **Technical SEO audit & checklist**  
   - Crawlability & indexability: sitemap, robots.txt, canonical tags, redirect chains, no-index issues.  
   - Core Web Vitals / page experience (loading speed, interactivity, layout shift) and mobile-first readiness.  
   - Site architecture: URL structure, internal linking, orphan pages, content silos.  
   - Schema/structured data implementation for relevant content (e.g., products, articles, FAQs).  
   - Entity & brand signals: make sure the site clearly establishes the brand entity, authorship, expertise, trust.  
   - Duplicate content problems, thin pages, low-value pages, “parasite” content risk.  
   - Redirects, HTTP→HTTPS, canonical consistency.  

2. **On-page & content optimization plan**  
   - For each primary target keyword: map to the most appropriate page type (commercial intent pages, informational guides, lists, comparisons) based on intent. (According to best practices, keyword intent must match page type.) :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
   - Title tags, meta descriptions, headings (H1, H2…), URLs: optimize to reflect keyword, intent, readability and brand.  
   - Content quality: ensure each page provides **information gain** (i.e., something unique, better, more helpful than competitor pages). :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
   - Use synonyms / LSI (latent semantic) terms, don’t stuff keywords. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
   - Optimize images: filenames, alt text, captions; compress to speed up. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  
   - Ensure content structure is clear (scan-friendly headings, bullet lists, table of contents if long) because clarity and context matter more than ever for search engines and generative AI. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}  
   - Update existing content: refresh older posts/pages that are under-performing or outdated. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}  
   - For multimedia: integrate video/infographics where useful (since user engagement and multi-format content help). :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}  

3. **Off-page & brand/authority signals**  
   - Link-building strategy: focus on earning high-quality, relevant backlinks, mentions, citations — treat linking like PR, not just SEO. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}  
   - Brand entity optimization: ensure consistent brand mention, author credentials, expert quotes, case-studies to boost E-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trust) as recognized by Google. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}  
   - Monitor brand search volume, brand mentions across social/forums/LLMs because generative search is evolving. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}  

4. **Generative / AI-driven search readiness**  
   - Recognize that users may find you via AI answer engines (LLMs) and not just classic search results. Focus on structured data, answer-friendly content, clear Q&A sections. :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}  
   - Optimize for “zero‐click” and featured snippet opportunities: use FAQ schema, list formats, succinct answers to common queries.  
   - Make sure content is structured so that AI-systems can easily extract facts, data, summaries, not just generic text.  

5. **Measurement & KPIs**  
   - Set baseline metrics: organic traffic, keyword rankings, click-through rates (CTR), bounce rates, dwell time, Core Web Vitals.  
   - Use tools: Google Search Console, analytics, crawl-audit tools, backlink trackers. :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}  
   - Establish a process: audit → implement → monitor → iterate. Note that SEO gains may take weeks or months. :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}  

**Implementation instructions for Claude Code:**  
- Accept input: keywords list, research data, site audit data, current content inventory.  
- Produce structured output: e.g., (A) Technical Task List with priority, (B) Page-by-page optimization table (URL | target keyword | intent | title suggestion | meta description suggestion | heading structure suggestions | internal link suggestions), (C) Content calendar (topics, keywords, format, repurpose plan), (D) Off-site/authority building plan (list of outreach opportunities, mention strategy), (E) Monitoring & KPI dashboard template.  
- Provide clear next-steps for each recommendation (who does it? how long? what tool? what measurement?).  
- Highlight any “low-hanging fruit” that can be executed quickly for early wins.  
- Flag any high-risk/low-value items or outdated tactics (for example, keyword-stuffing, irrelevant mass links) and explain why they’re risky now.  
- Use plain language but include enough detail to be actionable.

**Your tone:** professional, direct, no fluff. Prioritize win-orientation: “what actions produce the highest ROI fastest” while also covering fundamental setup for long-term success.

**Constraints & Notes:**  
- Avoid recommending black-hat tactics or shortcuts that could lead to penalties (e.g., manipulative links, hidden text).  
- Ensure all recommendations align with current search engine guidelines (e.g., Google’s Search Essentials) and recent best practices. :contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}  
- Because the search landscape is evolving (especially with generative AI), build the site and content to be future-proof: clear entities, structured data, brand presence.  
- Use your keyword list strategically — map to intent, avoid stuffing, build clusters and content pillars rather than dozens of scattered pages trying to rank for single keywords.

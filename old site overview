# Options Profit Calculator - Site Summary

## What It Is:
A free web tool that calculates potential profit and loss for basic options trades. It helps traders visualize how much money they could make or lose on a call or put option at different stock prices.

## How It Works:

**Inputs you provide:**
- Strategy type (long call, long put, short call, short put)
- Current stock price
- Strike price (the price at which the option can be exercised)
- Premium (what you paid/received for the option)
- Expiration date
- Number of contracts

**What it calculates:**
- Maximum profit potential
- Maximum loss potential
- Break-even price (where you neither make nor lose money)
- Profit/loss at expiration for any stock price
- Return on investment percentages

**The math behind it:**
- For **long calls**: Profit = (Stock Price - Strike Price - Premium) × 100 × Contracts
- For **long puts**: Profit = (Strike Price - Stock Price - Premium) × 100 × Contracts
- For **short options**: You receive premium upfront, profit if option expires worthless

## How It Looks:

**Current UI (pretty dated):**
- Simple white background with basic form fields
- Dropdown menus and text inputs stacked vertically
- A basic line chart showing profit/loss curve (green above $0, red below)
- Plain table below showing P/L at different stock prices
- Minimal styling - very "Excel spreadsheet" vibe
- Results displayed in a simple grid/table format
- Not very mobile-friendly
- No dark mode, no animations, very utilitarian

**The good parts:**
- Clear labeling of inputs
- Chart effectively shows the profit/loss profile
- Results are accurate and update instantly

**What needs improvement:**
- Looks like it was built in 2010
- Data presentation is cluttered
- Chart is small and not interactive
- Mobile experience is clunky
- No visual hierarchy - everything has equal weight
- Colors are bland (just basic green/red)

Basically, it **works perfectly** but **looks terrible**. All the functionality is there, it just needs a modern coat of paint and better information architecture.

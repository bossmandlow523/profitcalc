# PROJECT BRIEF: Options Profit Calculator Rebuild

## Objective:
Rebuild optionsprofitcalculator.com with modern UI/UX while preserving all calculation functionality.

## What We're Doing:

### 1. EXTRACT
- Pull all formulas and calculation logic from downloaded site files
- Document options pricing math (calls, puts, break-even, P/L calculations)
- Preserve calculation accuracy - this is the core value

### 2. MODERNIZE UI
- Use **shadcn/ui MCP** to build professional component library
- Pull a **SaaS template** as foundation for layout/design system
- Implement dark mode, smooth animations, responsive design
- Transform "Excel spreadsheet" look into polished web app

### 3. REBUILD
- React + Tailwind CSS + shadcn components
- Recharts for interactive profit/loss visualization
- Card-based layout with clear visual hierarchy
- Mobile-first responsive design

## Tech Stack:
- **Base**: SaaS landing page template
- **Components**: shadcn/ui via MCP
- **Framework**: React with hooks
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Charts**: Recharts
- **Logic**: Extracted formulas from original site

## Key Features to Preserve:
- Real-time P/L calculations
- Break-even price display
- Interactive profit/loss chart
- Support for long/short calls and puts
- Data table with price points

## Outcome:
Same powerful calculator, looks like a modern fintech SaaS product instead of a 2010 website.
